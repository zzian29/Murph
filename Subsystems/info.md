# Place to store files for individual subsystems or functions used in the main demo programs

## Includes things like
- PI Control
- Logic/Math/Functions used to calculate distance and control 3 ultrasonic sensors in unison
- Line following conditions
- Dual Motor Control Basics
- Wheel Encoder logic

We should be keeping isolated and working versions of these subsystems with their I/O assignments
identical to that of the assingments in the demo files
